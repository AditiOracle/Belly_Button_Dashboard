**Module 12 Challenge**

**Belly Button Bio Diversity**

**Overview:**

In this challenge we are creating the belly button data dashboard for demographic information of each individual and visualizing the data using different parameters using bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart.

**Bar chart shows** -\&gt; the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual&#39;s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage

**Bubble chart shows** -\&gt;the sample values for each OUT\_IDS for the selected individual.

**Gauge Chart shows** -\&gt;the weekly washing frequency&#39;s value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

------------------

I have added three customization to the dashboard:

1. Add information about what each graph visualizes, either under or next to each graph.

2. Change the layout of the page.

3. Add a navigation bar that allows you to select the bar or bubble chart on the page.
